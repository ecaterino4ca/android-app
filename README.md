The 'MOvieBILE' will be a mobile prototype of IMDB site.

There will be 2 types of users: ADMIN who will be responsible to add new movies to the general list, update their scores and other information related to the general list, and USER - a simple client of the application, who is able to manage the personalized movie list.

The application will allow user to view the general list of the movies, manage a personalized list of favourite movies (update the content of the list, delete the unwanted ones and add new movies). Users will have the possibility to register into the application and visualize a chart of most rented movies. The application will offer online and offline support, in case that users have internet connectivity issues. The user will have the option to subscribe to the new movies and receive email notification when new movies appear. The application will offer seemless switch between screens using highly interactive animations.
